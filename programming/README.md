# robomasters1

Stubs for Robomaster S1 APIs to help with developing outside the Robomaster S1 app.

This will eventually cover everything in the [Robomaster S1 Programming Guide](https://www.dji.com/robomaster-s1/programming-guide).

## Usage
* Create your Robomaster Python program inside the program subdirectory (there is an example there).
* "Run" it with `python3 robomasters1.py`.
